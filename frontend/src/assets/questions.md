# NMap questions

## Port search full

What is the argument used to search the ports using full 3-way TCP handshake?

Let's try `tiwio` code blocks in `oinie` line.

= 1
- `-sT`
- `-sS`
- `-sN`
- `-sX`

This should be trivial.

## Search hosts

What is the argument used to ping search hosts?

= 1
- `-lp`
- `-ll`
- `-la`
- `-lb`

I hope you read the instructions.

## Search specific hosts

How can you tell nmap to search only the network 10.0.0.0-10.0.0.255?

= 2
- `10.0.0.0/8`
- `10.0.0.0/16`
- `10.0.0.0/24`
- `10.0.0.0-10.0.0.255`

## Very long question

Here are some very long questions, both in pre, and in clear

= 1
- `some really long command that you should never enter in your terminal without really close verification`
- the same but a really long text, which should in fact not really be used as an answer, because it is not readable

## Very long multi-choice

Here are some very long questions, both in pre, and in clear, but this time for a multi-choice question.

= 2
- `some really long command that you should never enter in your terminal without really close verification`
- the same but a really long text, which should in fact not really be used as an answer, because it is not readable

## The end
